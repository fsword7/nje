Well, lately there have been several per day.

Now I am inclined to classify this as a pretty good one :)
I have found several lesser, and larger problems over the last
few days.  As of now I am running it in a debugger with
a thing called "debugging malloc" (edit the Makefile, if you
don't have it -- propably you don't have it, it is ZMailer's
libmalloc..)

So far so good, now it should run over the weekend unattended
(as if I stay away from the office...)

Hello,

	I have now created a new source-dump of FUNETNJE
	into FUNET file archive at directory URL:

	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/unix/networking/bitnet/

	The dump is there with names:
		funetnje-2.999.tar.gz
		funetnje-950610.tar.gz

	Because the documentation is not fully completed,
	and potential problems do exist, I don't yet call
	it 3.0 ..  (That problem appears on interaction
	with JNET, which does not like our active opened
	connection, and reports bad BCB sequence number..
	Manager of FIPORT said that JNET quality has dropped
	lately, so it may be a problem in there as well.
	It does NOT occur on link to FINHUTC - real IBM,
	nor to other FUNETNJE.. )

	I have successfully stress-tested the NJE-transport
	in between two FUNETNJEs, one on DEC 3000/900 AXP
	with OSF/1 (sort of UNIX), other on a 486/33 with
	Linux-1.2.9.  They have now sent tens of files to
	each other both directions simultaneously, and done
	so without a glitch (at the start of the link there
	were some 70-80 files on both machines waiting to
	be sent to  NOBODY@other_end.  Before last night's
	marathon session such workload was enough to cause
	communication error(s) to appear.)

	Production transmissions over the FINFILES-FIPORT
	link to the main network have always been successfull,
	but likely much less stressfull :-)
